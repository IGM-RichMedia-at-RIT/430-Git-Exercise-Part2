In the highest room of the tallest tower of the newly built castle in the Kingdom of Azirourth, a single candle slowly burned.  It stood upon a intricately carven wooden table.  Beside it lay a small crystal ball and several hand-written books.  
On one of those books was the wrinkled hand of the prophet, in his other, his wooden cane.  He trembled while supporting his frail body and said in a soft but raspy whisper, which echoed throughout the small, stone room,
"By the time the moon is once again full, the seven kings will have fallen, sorrow will sweep across the land, leaving nothing but darkness.  The dark eighth king will rise, and dictate the world cruelly with the support of his followers."
The prophet's eyes then rolled back into his head, and he toppled limply to the ground.  His body then filled with an eternal coldness.
Now, crouched at his side, with his last words scribbled on a torn piece of paper, was a fifteen year old schoolboy named Johann.  Johann placed his hand upon the prophet’s chest to feel for his heart beat, but he felt nothing more than the cold, slippery texture of his black, silken robe.
For a moment, Johann merely knelt there, frozen.  He watched the shadows solemnly dance about the walls.  Suddenly, the candle died, along with its shadows, it's warm light replaced by the somber light of the moon, which poured in through the room's one small window.
Johann now quickly stood up and ran down the cold, torch-lit hallway.  His footsteps echoed in a chilling way, as he found his way to the throne room to alert the king of the prophet's death.  When he reached the throne room, he hesitated before slowly pushing open the heavy, wooden double door.  The room spilled its light out into the hallway.  
Johann placed his foot on the long, red carpet that led to the throne.  He began to slowly approach the king.
As he walked, he examined the room.  He noticed that a candle-filled chandelier hung from the ceiling, producing an ironically comforting mood.  The wall panels were immensely decorated with gold.  Besides the built-in decorations however, the room was practically entirely unfurnished.  
Johann's eyes followed the carpet up to the throne.  The throne stood upon a red, carpeted platform, which had three long step in the front.  Beside it stood a small table on which was a wooden bowl of grapes; behind it, a dark red curtain.  The throne was entirely plated with gold and twice as tall as the king.  In it were several crystals varying in color.  On it was a large, blue cushion; on that, perched King Albert III.
The king sat there, seemingly ignorant of Johann, as he merrily popped grapes into his mouth while keeping a slight smile on his face.  Johann slowly approached him.  He stopped slightly before the steps and bowed his head.  
"Your Majesty ," he said, unsure of whether the king was yet aware of his presence. 
"Yes?" Replied the king, in between grapes, to which he still gave full attention.
	"The prophet is dead," Johann said in a solemn voice.  The king picked up a small white cloth and wiped his mouth, now looking Johann in the eyes, but still slowly popping grapes into his mouth.  
King Albert III, uncertain of how to reply to such shocking news, stroked his short, gold-blond, beard.  He then ran his finger through his shoulder-length, wavy hair, which matched his beard in color.
Johann concluded that the king was void of any responses, so he spoke again.
"Before his death, he delivered one last prophecy."
The king pushed his bowl a small amount away from him, as if to indicate that his entire attention was now focused on Johann, who now more closely approached him and handed him the paper containing the quote.
The king read it, then quickly glanced at his grapes as if to seek comfort.  He then looked sternly at Johann. 
"There is little I can do," he said wearily.
"My kingdom is new, and thus small, and weak," he added, as he leaned forward in order to hand the paper back to Johann.
 	"You must alert King Baltasar,"  the king paused.
"His kingdom is the largest, oldest, and most powerful kingdom of the seven," he said boldly.
The king now rose and walked down the steps.  He walked down the carpet and motioned for Johann to follow.  He didn't speak, as he now exited the throne room and abruptly turned once he reached the hallway's center.  Walking briskly down the hallway, he began to speak.
"I will send you on a coach to Baltasar's Kingdom of Zadgar.  It is a four day journey, it is essential that all needed supplies are brought," he spoke, as they began to walk down a deep, spiral staircase.  Upon reaching the bottom, which let out into the ballroom, Johann spotted the large gate leading outside.  The king pushed it open, and led Johann outside.  They walked down the rock path that weaved through the bare willows.
Johann's gaze drifted to the clear,  dark sky.  He curiously examined the currently full moon.  King Albert III signaled for him to stop, which he did, as the king approached a coach.  After speaking briskly to the driver, the king quickly walked back to Johann, he then handed him a large, gold coin.  
"This will pay for the journey," he quickly spoke in a soft, low tone.
"The coach shall depart at sunrise tomorrow. You must go home now, you must be well rested for your long trip tomorrow.  Farewell, I hope we will someday unite again," he whispered emphatically, as he swiftly turned, and began back to the castle, walking against the wind.
Johann watched for a moment, watched the late fall's nipping wind viciously blow the kings long, maroon, silken robe; the king bent forward and pulled his arms to his slightly chilled body, and trudged forward.  Johann then turned his head and slowly trotted over an open, moonlit hill, then disappeared into the shadows of the village's trees.

Scarlet light poured from behind the tree-peppered hills.  Johann slipped into his breeches, hose, and shirt.  He then pulled on his doublet and linen tunic.  As soon as 
his turnshoes were on, and he'd put his pattens over them, he grabbed his food-filled burlap bag, and sprinted outside.
He paused momentarily and took a deep breath of the crisp, cool air.  Glancing at the emerging morning light, Johann quickly made his way to the coach, as he needed to arrive there before the sun peeked over the horizon.  When he reached the top of a large hill, he glanced down and saw it waiting just at the other side.  He scrambled down the hill, reaching it just as the sun became visible.  Panting, he handed the driver the gold coin given to him by the king, then slowly stepped in.  As soon as he was seated, The two white horses began pulling the coach over the hills and on the way to Baltasar's Kingdom of Zadgar.
Johann reached into his bag and removed a cloth wrapped loaf of dark, rye bread.  Knowing that he hadn't more than this and several pieces of fruit to last the entirety of the four day period over which he would be traveling, he tore off no more than a slice's corner and began taking small bites.  As he ate, his thoughts drifted back to the prophet and his prophecy.  He imagined his wrinkled lips forming the loud, echoed whispers.  A chill shot down his spine, which he followed with a quick shake of the head, as though to clear his mind and let another, more pleasant thought, wander in.
     Johann examined his current surroundings as the coach bounced over a small hill covered in long grass which flowed in the direction of the chilling wind.  
"Zadgar," he mouthed, as he released a refreshing, deep breath of cool air.  He tried to imagine a castle grander than that of Arizourth, but such a castle seemed unfathomable.  He created a mental image of Arizourth's castle and smiled slightly.  The castle had an overall cubic shape, with a cylindrical tower at each corner, each tower varying in size.  Crenelations lined the towers' tops as well as the perimeter of the castle's main section.  In front of it, were several gnarled willows, which parted to each side of the the rock path that led to the entrance, beckoning.  
With his mind, Johann walked the path, and through the castle's gates.  His made his way the the highest level of the castle, and glided quickly down the cool, stone halls.  The throne room seemed to summon his thoughts, and he began to mentally explore it.  The room's overall bareness caused the throne to draw his attention.  On the throne, he saw King Albert III and imaged having the king's power himself, and craved it.
Johann's realization of desire burst into in his consciousness.  But knowing that his family's wealth assured him a quite elegant life, guilt promptly pushed it from his conscious mind.  But within his subconscious, the notion lingered.  That night he dreamt of power.  The desires grew, and twisted, and evolved.  Dreams of the sought power's obtention grew; consisting of most ominously desirable circumstances.  
The next day passed without Johann absorbing the aspects of the reality he was living; he lived within his own mind.  He experienced no more than his own fantasies, than the world he wanted to.  The fantasies developed in his mind, and their complexity eventually reached, or perhaps surpassed the complexity of his own existence.  It seemed as though he was in a trance, every move made by his physical body coordinated by such a small portion of his conscious mind, which had now become nearly entirely consumed with processing the information present in a nonexistent realm.
Johann reached for a piece of bread, his eyes looking forward though, glazed over.  He ate slowly, but at a constant pace, however couldn't analyze his actions to the extent that he realized the need for the bread's reservation.  And if there hadn't, at that moment, been a viciously flowing river into which the coach continued, he would've just kept eating.  But the river woke him from his trance, it's merciless water rushing past him, just beneath the boards upon which he sat.  
Johann’s surrounding fell into his consciousness.  He returned the bread to its bag, instantly regretting the meager amount of it.  
Springing to his feet, Johann's eyes widened, the horses miraculously trudged forward though, the frigid water rushing around them.  As his head turned to the left, fear practically paralyzed him; suddenly, a white wall of raging rapids vigorously approached him.  He began to suck in a breath.  As soon as his lungs were full, the boards beneath his feet gave way, and his fate was dropped into the hands of the water by which he had just been swallowed.

	Blurred scarlet light met Johann’s squinting eyes as he lifted his heavy eyelids.  He felt his body warm and wrapped in cloth and calmly bouncing.  He sat up and realized that he had been lying in a most elegant coach.  Peering out the window, he saw a colossal stone, and on that stone was written, largely and beautifully, in a sacred script, “Welcome to the Kingdom of Zadgar.”
	His heart skipped a beat.  He sat up and looked into the driver’s seat.  The man sitting there was clothed and hooded by a violet-colored silken robe.  Clipped onto his seat was a bronze sword with precious stones embellishing the handle.
	“Excuse me,” Johann began, uncertain of how to continue, as he knew not this man’s title.  But by the his robe, the stones in his sword, and the bronze from which it was made, he sensed power or wealth.  The most obvious assumption would be that he was a baron, or count, or someone who could be called a lord.  But seeing as he knew no more of this man than what he wore and carried, he decided to give him the honorable title of a prince, so he began to speak again,
	“Your Royal Highness—” he continued, then the driver interrupted and began speaking himself,
	“I have not been addressed by those word since the death of my father four decades ago.  I am travelling from my Kingdom; I am King Alfred of Sabidia.”
	Johann’s sat silently in disbelieving awe.  He had been told many tales of King Alfred, the Wise King.  The coach rolled through the gates of Zadgar, which was guarded by two knights, who gave a slight bow as the coach passed.  He then looked forward, and saw the castle.
 And such a grand castle it was, thrice as high and twice as wide as Arizourth’s; covered in an array of inset windows, narrow and tall, and rounded on top; a beautifully shaped balcony on the east side, glowing orange from the dawn’s bright light.  It was much less of a blocky castle too, with dozens of cylinders topped with upside-down cones.  The cylinders were smooth and white, the cones tiled black.  And somewhere within it, was King Baltasar.
The coach slowed and stopped before the castle.  The king got off his horse and Johann stepped out of the coach, starved, weak and thirsty. 
King Alfred pushed off his hood.  Johann examined his long, straight, white hair and equally long, straight, and white beard.  He had lively blue eyes though, despite his age.
The king handed Johann a cantene of water and a piece of bread, both of which he finished in a matter of seconds.
"Thank you," said Johann, quickly, and somewhat breathlessly.  The king nodded and smiled slightly.  He then began to speak,
"What are you called?  Where do you come from?" he kindly asked.
"I am Johann, son of Count George.  I come from Arizourth.  I have been on a journey to Zadgar to deliver to King Baltasar a prophecy from the now deceased Prophet of Arizourth."
The king slowly shook his head.  He walked toward the heavy entrance doors and knocked.  They were opened by four knights, two per door.  Johann and King Alfred walked swiftly in, the king gestured for Johann to turn right.  And so Johann turned right, and King Alfred turned left, and Johann searched for the throne room in curious and clueless solitude.
Red carpets muffled his footsteps and the windows' sunlight lit his way: Johann walked down a wide hall toward a large double staircase.  And although his torn scrap of paper, home of the prophet's last words, has been stolen by the river, he knew those words by heart, and whispered them as he walked, over, and over again.  
He walked up the right side of that staircase and upon reaching the top glanced leftward.  And there he saw the throne room, more of a hall it was, for it hadn't any door.  The walls were wooden and covered in windows and one long carpet led to the throne.  The throne was on a platform, twelve steps tall, and on it sat the most powerful man in all of the seven kingdoms: King Baltasar of Zadgar.
Quite a burly man he was, unshaven and brawny.  His hair was long, dark brown, and snarled.  He wore a long gray robe which half revealed his muscular arms practically tearing through his doublet.  Two peasants stood to his left, feeding him beer and buttered pork.
Johann carefully stepped onto the carpet. 
"Your Magesty King Baltasar," he addressed him, then fell to his knees and knelt there momentarily to show respect. By the time he was once again standing, the king had risen too, his face red with anger.
"I was not expecting visitors!" he bellowed, his sword in hand.  Johann backed against a wall.  He looked at the sword, made of steel, and as tall as a ten year old child.  The king lifted the sword above his head, prepared to throw.  He then hurled it toward Johann, across the entirety of the throne room.
Johann froze in shock for a moment and, in panic, moved his stunned body from the path of the flying sword.
The sword hit the wall and slid half its length into it, in the space between Johann's left arm and torso, the spot where his heart had been just moments earlier.
With his heart racing, his tunic pinned to the wall, Johann attempted to remove the sword  It didn't move.  The king leapt down his twelve stairs in four strides and began charging at Johann at an astonishing speed.
Johann pulled away, the sword tearing his tunic, yet by the time he had freed himself, the king had reached him and effortlessly pulled the sword from the wall.  
Johann breathed heavily and began backing away.  The king held his sword sideways in alignment with Johann's neck.  He brought it back, prepared to swing.  
"Your Majesty!" Johann cried,
"Spare me!"  He felt sickened and powerless.  The king ignored his cries and swung the sword.
Johann's body tensed as he sucked in a breath, what he believed to be his last.  Even in this moment preceding seemingly certain death, though, Johann felt no anger for the king, merely envy, for he knew that if he had King Baltasar's power, he would behave no differently than the king behaved now.  Yet mid-swing, the steel sword was stopped by a bronze one. 
King Alfred stood behind Johann, the metal of his sword slowly scraping against King Baltasar's. 
"He means no harm," he scolded King Baltasar loudly, his voice becoming louder each word he spoke.
King Baltasar narrowed his eyes and slowly withdrew his sword.  
"There has been a prophecy," Johann said softly and in fear, directed at the man who had just thoughtlessly attempted his decapitation.
"The prophecy was given to me by the no longer living prophet of Arizourth," he said, then recited the well rehearsed speech of the prophet's words.
King Baltasar sighed heavily and groaned.
"The royalty from all kingdoms shall meet tomorrow," he announced boredly and rather monotonically.  King Alfred squinted at him and slightly rounded his lips, as if about to speak.  He made a noise in this throat, then word finally began to escape his mouth,
"The nearest kingdom is a three day journey from here," he said, "the farthest nearly twelve," he finished, slowly shaking his head.  
"Then the meeting shall take place in three days!" responded King Baltasar.  
"Twelve days," King Alfred corrected him, speaking slowly and clearly, baffled by King Baltasar's blatant stupidity.  Johann simply stood there, amused by this exchange.  
"Come with me," said King Alfred, as he began walking down the hall, his violet robe trailing behind him.
"I will take you to a room in which to stay while you are here, I intend to have you invited to our royal gathering, as you are perhaps one of the most knowledgeable people regarding this prophecy," he said as he walked, Johann nodded, feeling pleased and as though he had a drop of power.  
After many strides and turns, King Alfred led Johann into one of many doors in one of the many hallways of the castle of Zadgar.  The room was rather large, containing furniture made for a noble or lord.  Johann’s attention was particularly captured by the canopy bed, such a novelty he found it.
King Alfred watched Johann enter the room, then gently closed the door and walked away down the seemingly-endless stone hallways.

Much time had passed, long enough for a messenger to get to the furthest kingdom, Athalar, and return with its royalty.  By this point, Johann knew the castle inside out.  He has slept in it for the twenty-fourth day, under the watch of the waxing moon, steadily approaching its inevitable state of fullness once again.  He awoke with a nervous excitement, prepared to discuss the prophecy: King Valtin had arrived from Athalar.  Johann flung open his room’s weighty door, and briskly walked to the Great Hall.
King Baltasar was seated at the end of a long wooden table with three wooden chairs at each side.  The wood was dark, and carved profoundly.  On the right, closest to the the most powerful King, sat King Alfred.  And at the opposite side, where Johann stood, were King Albert III and King Valtin, seated across from each other.  King Albert III and Johann briefly exchanged a faint smile.  The remaining three seats quickly filled, and the meeting commenced.  
King Baltasar looked at the Kings blankly, he looked at the princes, queens, and princesses— along with Johann— that lined the walls, whom he had forbidden to sit or speak.  He had no words, there were no words to be spoken, there was not yet any dark king.  King Alfred broke the cold silence.
“If the prophecy is an account of the future, does it not account for the meeting we are presently having?  All of the this prophet’s wicked prophecies— and they have all been wicked— have come true, regardless of our doings.  Perhaps we should, rather than prepare for battle in our defence, for the sake of our own lives, resign our positions as kings, and let the happenings that are to come occur, without us being seen as threats to the incoming power.”  Another moment of stillness and silence fell upon them, in which six gathered minds pondered the words of the the wise king.  King Albert III was the first to respond.
“Without a King there is no structure, the kingdoms will certainly fall into anarchy and chaos.  There must be a leader,” he said.
“But that leader needs not be labeled a King,” began King Alfred.  “A King is seen as far too threatening and will certainly be killed by the approaching dark forces.  We need someone to act as leader who is not given the label of King.  He should, if it given King Balthasar’s ok, be stationed here in Zadgar’s castle.”
King Baltasar’s fists tightened and he breathed heavily, upset originally by the request for him to resign his power, and now further angered the request that someone live in and rule from his castle.  
“There is no need for me to resign!” he bellowed.  “I can set my army against the dark king, or fight him with my own blade!”
King Valtin rose abruptly.  “Suppress your arrogance, your Majesty.  We have no idea how powerful the dark king may be.  If, upon his arrival, we find him weak enough to combat, we may change our plans.”  He looked at the other kings for approval, and they timidly nodded.  King Baltasar remained still.  After a moment, he viciously sprung from his seat, simultaneously drawing his iron blade, and unleashed his selfish lividity on King Valtin, who quickly drew his own sword and stopped King Baltasar’s blow.  Within an instant, King Baltasar had five swords at his neck, each in the hand of an expert swordsman.  He breathed shallow, rapid breaths.  “I agree with your plan,” he slowly said, clearly indicating in his tone that he said this because he had no other option, as a last resort.  The five kings withdrew their swords, and King Balthasar shortly did the same, freeing King Valtin from his defensive pose.
“Who will become the new leader then?” he asked irritatedly.  Johann, not wanting to give up this unique opportunity, quickly spoke.  
“I will, your Majesty,” he said breathlessly.  King Baltasar looked at him in disgust, awed that he would dare to speak against his order forbidding those not kings from speaking.  The other kings nodded thoughtfully, and one by one turned up one corner of their mouths.
“You are perhaps exactly who we need,” said King Alfred.  Nobody will be threatened by a boy who does not come from the family of a king.  All but King Baltasar nodded immediately in agreeance, however not wanting to again be pinned at the ends of the kings’ blades, he quickly decided to join them.  “You may go to the throne room, we’ll cast you a kingly sword,”  King Alfred continued, “you may order Zadgar’s army to perform any action you request, do what you must to retain order and prepare for, if possible, the dark king.”  Johann smiled.  Then, reminding himself of the situation, tried to constrict his expression to one of solemnity.  He walked to the throne room, followed by the former seven kings. 
 As he walked, Johann once again played back the prophet’s words in his head.  He watched his wrinkled lips form the words “the dark eighth king will rise,” which he suddenly realized meant that the dark king was already present in Zadgar, though had not yet risen.  Johann turned into the throne room, but the kings ceased to follow.
“Your sword will have been cast by sunrise tomorrow,” said King Alfred.  The kings then parted and walked off into the castle, a battle within each of them raging between regret and morality.

Johann had not slept.  He stood upon a balcony and watched the sun mask the taunting moon.  Throughout the night, Johann had been thinking.  He turned around and retreated into the castle, and as soon as he had, King Alfred approached him and handed him a blade.  The exchange was silent: King Alfred and Johann exchanged a bow of the head and parted.
Johann began toward the room of General Hans.  He decided that in order to prevent an uprising by the Dark King, all suspects must be killed.  He would order General Hans to have his military select all possible suspects and execute them by guillotine.  Johann knocked on his door.  After giving his order, General Hans nodded and prepared to line the streets with guillotines.  Johann returned to the balcony, and watched.  
As the hours passed, shrieks of terror filled the kingdom as lines of people formed behind the each guillotine.  Johann tried to feel sorrow, but his overwhelming hubris forbade it.  The guillotines commenced, and as each second passed, dozens of lives came to an end, dozens of people simply ceased to exist.  But Johann could do no more than stand infatuated by his power.  As the day moved on, the sun set, and a full moon rose behind ominous clouds, occasionally peering out through an opening.

A king, though not titled a king, once just a boy named Johann, stood upon a balcony, watching the lines of hopeless victims behind guillotines slowly progress, all under his command.  Carts of bodies and decapitated heads rolled drearily through the cold, muddy streets, as chilled rain poured from the raging skies.  Within this king, an ember of conscience ignited for the last time.  This ember was all that remained of the schoolboy named Johann.  But during this moment, Johann relived the last words of the prophet, relived the way his cold, grey eyes looked through his soul, relived the shaky words formed by his wrinkled, pale lips: "By the time the moon is once again full, the seven kings will have fallen, sorrow will sweep across the land, leaving nothing but darkness.  The dark eighth king will rise, and dictate the world cruelly with the support of his followers."  The seven kings had in fact fallen, and sorrow has indeed swept across the land.  One last realization then fell upon the dying ember of Johann: the dark king had risen, and he was looking through his eyes.  He was looking through the eyes of a king who had cruelly commanded the deaths of innocent people, a king, who, despite this, was encouraged by the former seven, and all who feared an uprising.  With all the energy that remained within him, Johann shouted to the people below.
“Cease this murder!” he yelled.  The guillotines stopped, and Johann, against the Dark King’s will, retreated into the shadowy castle.  Johann drew the Dark King’s blade, but the Dark King resisted, attempting to resume the executions.  Johann was but an ember of conscience, but with all he had, he slowly rotated the blade toward himself, his hand quivering, while the Dark King struggled to keep it away.  As Johann’s energy emptied, the blade’s tip touched his robe.  And with his last drop of energy, miraculously drawn from the warmth of his conscience, Johann thrust the blade toward the Dark King, toward he who would have otherwise resumed finding pleasure in commanding death.  The following instant lasted much longer than an instant, it was that instant that determined the fate of hundreds of innocent people.  And as that instant transformed into the next, and that into the next, they both, Johann in bliss, and the Dark King in agony, fell limply to the ground.

In the Kingdom of Arizourth,  a single candle slowly burned.  Several people in dark and heavy clothing stood around it, silently mourning.  A crisp wind brought chills to these people, who continued their solemn stance unswayed, and it brought to the candle’s light an end.  
Beneath this now-lifeless candle lay a coffin, in which rested the cloaked body of an honored man.  Many tears were shed in this man’s grievance, though he did deserve these tears.  This man was called a prophet, but he was, rather, the most ingenious orchestrator of human extermination to have ever lived.

"Good morning. In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in this history of mankind."

"Mankind -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests."

Perhaps its fate that today is the 4th of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation. 
We're fighting for our right to live, to exist. And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared 
in one voice:"

"We will not go quietly into the night!
 We will not vanish without a fight!
 We're going to live on!
 We're going to survive!"
 Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!"

According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because Cheese don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Owen you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished Cheese,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These Cheese are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Owen anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But Cheese know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that Cheese,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're Cheese.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Cheese make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
Cheese cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of Cheese!

  
Owendy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Owen't fly in rain.

  
Owen't fly in rain.

  
Owen't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Cheese are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Owen I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Owen I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb Cheese!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Cheese make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Cheese don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset Cheese!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Cheese hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The Cheese!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than Cheese!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!

  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Cheese have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Cheese have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Cheese must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the Cheese of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all Cheese.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't free Cheese.
You keep Cheese. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill Cheese!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless Cheese
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Cheese have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking Cheese, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about Cheese.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing Cheese!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeyCheese
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the Cheese

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Cheese don't smoke.

  
Right. Cheese don't smoke.

  
Cheese don't smoke!
But some Cheese are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Cheese are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a bee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to Cheese who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these Cheese!

  
Free the Cheese! Free the Cheese!

  
Free the Cheese!

  
Free the Cheese! Free the Cheese!

  
The court finds in favor of the Cheese!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally belong to the Cheese.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
Barry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
Barry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

  
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

  
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Owen't breathe.

  
Bring it in, boys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Owennonball!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission abort.

  
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is everybody?

  
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey back.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would be better!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess Cheese.

  
Cheese?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think Cheese not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need Cheese.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How about a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
Barry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, Cheese, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
Barry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

  
- Cheese.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will be tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

  
Official floral business. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How about The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this baby'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

  
Owen you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
Be careful.

  
Owen I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
Bee!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, Barry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

  
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

  
As a matter of fact, there is.

  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

  
I can't fly a plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it be?

  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's Barry!

  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated flight crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with absolutely no flight experience.

  
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done enough damage.

  
But isn't he your only hope?

  
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

  
Their wings are too small...

  
Haven't we heard this a million times?

  
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

  
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

  
Making honey takes a lot of Cheese
doing a lot of small jobs.

  
But let me tell you about a small job.

  
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

  
That's why I want to get Cheese
back to working together.

  
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

  
We get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

  
Left, right, down, hover.

  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

  
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

  
Barry, what happened?!

  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

  
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

  
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

  
Move out!

  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

  
Don't have to yell.

  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

  
I can't do this!

  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

  
You snap out of it.

  
You snap out of it.

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

  
How is the plane flying?

  
I don't know.

  
Hello?

  
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

  
The Pollen Jocks!

  
They do get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

  
Where? I can't see anything. Owen you?

  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

  
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

  
Bring the nose down.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

  
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

  
Affirmative!

  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

  
Land on that flower!

  
Ready? Full reverse!

  
Spin it around!

  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

  
made of millions of Cheese!

  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

  
Rotate around it.

  
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

  
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

  
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

  
Aim for the center!

  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

  
Oome on, already.

  
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

  
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

  
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

  
Listen, everyone!

  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

  
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

  
That means this is our last chance.

  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

  
Are we going to be Cheese, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

  
We're Cheese!

  
Keychain!

  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

  
Hold on, Barry. Here.

  
You've earned this.

  
Yeah!

  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

  
Oh, yeah.

  
That's our Barry.

  
Mom! The Cheese are back!

  
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

  
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Owen I help who's next?

  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

  
I had no idea.

  
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

  
Sorry I'm late.

  
He's a lawyer too?

  
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

  
Have a great afternoon!

  
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

  
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

  
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Owen I help who's next?

  
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

  
Thank you, Barry!

  
That bee is living my life!

  
Let it go, Kenny.

  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

  
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

  
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

  
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

  
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Owen we stop here?

  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

  
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

Maybe that was a bit too much text...
